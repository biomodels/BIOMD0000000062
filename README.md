_BioModels Curation_ : The model reproduces Fig 3 of the publication. By
substituting a value of 1.4 for Tex it is possible to reproduce Fig 3C and
3D(iii), Fig 3A and 3D(i), are obtained by setting Tex=0. Also, note that the
tryptophan concentrations have been normalized by 82 micromolar in the
figures; the normalized concetrations can be obtained via the parameters
To/s/t_norm. The model was successfully tested on MathSBML and Copasi.
